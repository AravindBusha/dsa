1.  * variables are call by value(means each recurrsion function will have the different value) that means no need to modify in backtarcking,
    * all other datastructue except the varibales are call by reference( means in each recurssion function will have the same value) need to modify in backtracking 
 
  
2.  * list is a interface and arraylist is a class so we should create them as ( List<Integer> list=new ArrayList<>() ) or (  for  list of list type = List<List<Integer>> list =new ArrayList<>()  ) 

3.  QUEUE -> front(front pointer is incremented when ele are "deleted") -------- rear(rear pointer is incremented when "insertion" of ele are there)

4. pq -- add(), peek(), poll()
