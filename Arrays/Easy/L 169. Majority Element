169. Majority Element
https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/
Logic
1.said that it is more than n/2 times , that means it will be in the middle
2. if it is even then we can get at size/2 position 
3. but if it is odd then we need to take the value at size/2+1 position because oddNumber/2 will decrease the positoin by 1

    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {

        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int len=nums.length;
        if(len%2==0) return nums[(len/2)-1];
        return nums[len/2];
